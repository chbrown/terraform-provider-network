## terraform provider for network information

Right now it just provides your IP address by shelling out to `dig` and using OpenDNS's resolvers to echo back your IP by requesting the A record for the special name `myip.opendns.com`.

This is exposed as the value `wan_ip_address` on a (data) resource, `network_info`.


## Example

    data "network_info" "main" { }

    resource "aws_security_group" "cluster_sg" {
      ...

      ingress {
        from_port = 0
        to_port = 0
        protocol = "-1"
        cidr_blocks = ["${data.network_info.main.wan_ip_address}/32"]
      }

      description = "Group to allow all traffic from current location"
   }
