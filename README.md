## terraform provider for network information

Right now it just provides your IP address by shelling out to `dig` and using OpenDNS's resolvers to echo back your IP by requesting the `A` record for the special name `myip.opendns.com`, exactly like:

    dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com

This is exposed as the value `wan_ip_address` on a (data) resource named `network_info`.

(Terraform doesn't have a concept of singletons, but a data resource is closer to a singleton than a normal resource.)


## Install

First, use `go` to fetch and build:

    go get github.com/chbrown/terraform-provider-network

Then edit your `~/.terraformrc` to contain:

    providers {
      network = "/Your/absolute/expanded/GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-network"
    }

Where the value of `network` is an absolute path to the `terraform-provider-network` binary that `go get` just built.
Assuming you have the `GOPATH` environment variable set, this will be the value of `$GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-network`.


## Example

    # "local" can be anything you want
    data "network_info" "local" { }

    resource "aws_security_group" "cluster_sg" {
      ...

      ingress {
        from_port = 0
        to_port = 0
        protocol = "-1"
        cidr_blocks = ["${data.network_info.local.wan_ip_address}/32"]
      }

      description = "Group to allow all traffic from current location"
    }


## Debugging

If you get the cryptic error message:

    Error configuring: 1 error(s) occurred:

    * Incompatible API version with plugin. Plugin version: 1, Ours: 2

This means `terraform` has been updated to a version different from the libraries the plugin was built with.
The solution is to reinstall, by using `go get` with the `-u` flag:

    go get -u github.com/chbrown/terraform-provider-network
